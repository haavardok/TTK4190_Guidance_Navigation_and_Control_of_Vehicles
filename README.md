# TTK4190 Guidance, Navigation and Control of Vehicles
A repository made for the work [eliasoa](https://github.com/eliasoa), [sacitali](https://github.com/sacitali) and my work on the assignments solved in Matlab in this course, autumn 2023. The presented .m-files is my personal implementation of the solution to the assignments. Note that some building blocks were provided by the lecturer which I do not take credit for making. The PDFs represent the culmination of all three group members and may not precisely depict the same plots as those generated by executing my code.

The litterature used in this course is primarily the 2nd edition of [Thor Inge Fossen: Handbook of Marine Craft Hydrodynamics and Motion Control](https://www.wiley.com/en-in/Handbook+of+Marine+Craft+Hydrodynamics+and+Motion+Control,+2nd+Edition-p-9781119575054) with ISBN 9781119575054.
